   - removing special characters

4. having the dictornary of emotional words

   - for each tokenize word check is it emotinal words
   - if yes add emotion of this word it into list of emotions
6. get the frequency of different emotion from the emotinal list
7. plotting the bar graph showing the exact frequency of each emotion
